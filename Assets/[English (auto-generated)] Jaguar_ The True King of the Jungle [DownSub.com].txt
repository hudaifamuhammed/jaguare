the jaguar is the most feared predator

in latin america

not even the largest herbivores are safe

from one of the strongest bites in the

animal kingdom

and back in the day they could hunt

megafauna some of them as big as an

elephant

this is the giant slayer of the jungle

[Music]

hi i'm danielle defoe and you're

watching animal logic jaguars are as

cute as they are powerful

they're the wrestlers of the animal

kingdom

[Music]

their bodies with their powerful legs

sharp claws and stocky build are

designed to grapple their prey and to

sever their spines

this was the most effective method for

hunting their giant prehistoric prey

five hundred thousand years ago when

jaguars first entered south america the

continent was home to megafauna

some of the animals like the giant

ground sloth could be as big as

elephants

jaguars adapted quickly to their new

environment and became specialists in

giant killing

their strategy consists of using

camouflage to stalk their prey

[Music]

the rosettes on their skin help them

blend in with the dense jungle

when they're close enough they pounce on

their prey climbing on its back and

biting on its neck until it snaps

[Music]

if the prey is small enough they might

bite through the skull to stab the brain

with their long fangs

[Music]

this killing strategy requires immense

bite strength

jaguars are the strongest among all

felines even stronger than the much

larger siberian tiger

jaguar's jaws can produce 700 kilograms

of force and drag down animals as heavy

as a bowl

they can even crack open turtle shells

this diet sustained a large jaguar

population until an even deadlier

predator showed up

us

humans hunted all herbivores larger than

65 kilograms and the jaguars ranged to

extinction

and jaguars had to adapt their diet

before humans arrived jaguars would

feast on giant prime rib steak but in

the new world they had to satisfy

themselves with tapas

as a consequence of this they shrunk in

size

jaguars in the holocene could weigh up

to 200 kilograms but the largest modern

jaguars are about half of their

ancestor's size

in areas with low large prey density

they can be as small as 50 kilograms

but even these lilliputian jaguars are

incredible hunters and can catch even

the largest extant herbivores in the

tropical americas

their current diet consists mostly of

deer peccaries caimans and capybara

though monkeys and tapirs are also

caught on occasion

happy barra seemed to be their preferred

prey and it's not rare to find capybara

skulls with two perforations on their

sides

anything smaller than 20 kilograms is

usually not energy efficient enough for

a jaguar to chase

the smaller prey is mostly caught by

pumas which are simpatric with jaguars

their biggest available prey however are

domestic cattle which is a bit ironic

because they were introduced to america

by the same species that killed off all

of their historic prey

[Music]

brazil has the world's largest

population of cattle and vast expanses

of the amazon have been cut down to make

room for them

jaguars sometimes attack cows and are

very effective at killing them despite

being much smaller than them

unfortunately this has put them at odds

with ranchers who preemptively killed

jaguars to protect their herds but

ranchers aren't the only threat to these

felines poachers too kill jaguars and

sell their skin for as little as 20

dollars

this has led to a decline in jaguar

numbers and range

jaguars used to be found in every

country in the americas south of canada

but are now almost extinct in the

southern half of south america

there is a very small population of

jaguars in the united states in arizona

and new mexico

they include a celebrity jaguar named el

jefe which was originally thought to be

the only living jaguar in the u.s

he lives in the santa rita mountains of

arizona

though since 2016 other jaguars have

been reported

the american population of jaguars is

struggling

as more and more artificial barriers are

being put up they're unable to diversify

their populations by mating with the

larger population of jaguars in the

south

like all animals jaguars need a large

gene pool to maintain a healthy

population

thankfully there are some groups trying

to help

initiatives like the path of the jaguar

aim to connect separate jaguar

populations by rebuilding forest paths

so that they can mate with each other

it's only fair that after eating their

food we're finding them dates

so what should i talk about next please

logic every other week thanks for
